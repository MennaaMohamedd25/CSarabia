        <li className='my-[24px]'>Skidded Plug and Play Solutions:The Stauper Compact Flotation Unit (CFU) is a highly effective, robust and maintenance free solution for removing oil and gas from produced water.  As part of the Stauper patent portfolio, is also the unique design of having two or more complete cleaning stages in one pressure vessel. As such the Stauper CFU can be tied in directly at separator as the only produced water treatment process required. Where more volume is required, the Stauper Flotation Degasser can be deployed.</li>
        <li>Retrofit and Upgrade of Existing Vessels:Existing underperforming separation vessels can be upgraded by retrofitting the Stauper Coalescence Chamber into the vessel. This upgrade will improve oil from water separation, degassing of the water while improving flow capacity.  The retrofit process is completed in weeks and as a result existing equipment can be utilized. Improved separation will reduce the need for costly chemicals and improve environmental footprint. All work is done without the need for recertification of the pressure vessel.</li>
